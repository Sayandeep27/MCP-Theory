# 🚀 FastMCP — Complete Beginner to Advanced Guide

---

## 📌 What is FastMCP?

**FastMCP** is a lightweight Python framework used to quickly build servers that follow the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

In simple words:

> FastMCP helps you expose tools, functions, or data to LLMs (like Claude, GPT, etc.) in a standardized way using MCP.

It makes building MCP servers extremely easy — similar to how **FastAPI** makes building APIs easy.

---

# 🧠 Before Understanding FastMCP — What is MCP?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a protocol that allows:

* LLM Clients (like Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)
* To communicate with
* External tools / databases / functions

Using a structured format called **JSON-RPC**.

So instead of manually wiring LLM → tool calls,
MCP provides a standardized communication method.

FastMCP = A simple way to build MCP-compliant servers.

---

# 🏗 Architecture Overview

```
User → LLM Client → MCP Server (FastMCP) → Tools/Functions/DB
                                   ↑
                               JSON-RPC
```

### Step-by-step Flow:

1. User asks a question
2. Client sends request in JSON-RPC format
3. FastMCP server receives it
4. Server calls the correct tool/function
5. Tool returns result
6. Server sends response back in JSON-RPC
7. Client converts it into readable text

---

# ⚡ Why FastMCP is Needed?

Without FastMCP:

* You manually write MCP specification (VVI)
* Handle JSON-RPC manually  (VVI)
* Define tool schemas yourself
* Handle errors manually

With FastMCP:

* Decorator-based tool creation
* Automatic JSON-RPC handling
* Automatic schema generation
* Clean and minimal setup

It reduces boilerplate code significantly.

# 🔥 Core Features

| Feature           | Description                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Tool Registration | Register Python functions as MCP tools        |
| JSON-RPC Handling | Automatically manages request/response format |
| Schema Generation | Creates tool schema automatically             |
| Lightweight       | Minimal dependencies                          |
| Fast Development  | Build MCP server in minutes                   |

---

# 🛠 Installation

```bash
pip install fastmcp
```

---

# 🚀 Basic Example — Your First FastMCP Server

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("My MCP Server")

# Define a tool
@mcp.tool()
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

That’s it.

This automatically:

* Registers `add_numbers` as a tool
* Generates schema
* Handles JSON-RPC
* Makes it available to MCP clients

---

# 🧩 How Tools Work in FastMCP

When you write:

```python
@mcp.tool()
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello {name}"
```

FastMCP automatically:

1. Reads function name
2. Reads parameter types
3. Reads docstring
4. Generates MCP tool schema
5. Exposes it via JSON-RPC

No manual schema writing needed.

---

# 📦 Under the Hood (Technical View)

FastMCP internally:

* Uses JSON-RPC 2.0 standard
* Converts Python functions → MCP tools
* Validates input arguments
* Serializes output
* Handles errors properly

So your focus remains only on business logic.

---

# 🧠 How LLM Uses FastMCP Tools

When connected to an MCP client:

1. LLM sees available tools
2. LLM decides which tool to call
3. Sends JSON-RPC request
4. FastMCP executes function
5. Returns structured response
6. LLM formats final answer

So FastMCP does not generate text —
It executes tools.

---

# 🔄 FastMCP vs Manual MCP

| Manual MCP                   | FastMCP            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Write JSON-RPC manually      | Automatic handling |
| Define tool schemas manually | Auto schema        |
| Handle validation yourself   | Auto validation    |
| More boilerplate             | Minimal code       |

---

# 📁 Real Use Cases

You can use FastMCP to:

* Connect LLM to databases
* Connect LLM to APIs
* File system access tools
* ML model inference tools
* RAG pipelines
* Business automation tools

---

# 🧪 Advanced Example — Tool with Validation

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Advanced Server")

@mcp.tool()
def divide(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Divide two numbers"""
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

FastMCP will automatically:

* Catch exception
* Send proper JSON-RPC error
* Client displays error safely

---

# 🧵 Multiple Tools Example

```python
@mcp.tool()
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a * b

@mcp.tool()
def subtract(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a - b
```

One server → Multiple tools.

---

# 🌐 How to Connect to MCP Client

After running:

```bash
python app.py
```

You configure the MCP client (like Claude Desktop) to connect to your server.

Client discovers tools automatically.

---

# 🏁 Production Considerations

For production:

* Add logging
* Add authentication layer
* Restrict tool permissions
* Deploy behind secure server
* Use environment variables for secrets

---

# 🎯 Key Concepts Summary
