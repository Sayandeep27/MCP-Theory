# MCP Server Can Expose Multiple Tools

---

## Core Idea

One client connects with one server only.
One MCP server can have multiple tools/data source(like db)
Think of an MCP server like a toolbox provider.
Instead of running one tool per server, a single MCP server can expose many related tools.

---

# Example: GitHub MCP Server

Suppose you create one **GitHub MCP Server**.
Inside that one server, you can define multiple tools like:

* `create_repository`
* `delete_repository`
* `create_issue`
* `list_pull_requests`
* `merge_pull_request`

---

## Architecture Flow

```
AI Host (Chatbot)

GitHub MCP Client → connects 1:1 → GitHub MCP Server
```

---

## Inside the GitHub MCP Server

```
GitHub MCP Server

Tool 1: Create Repo
Tool 2: Create Issue
Tool 3: Merge PR
Tool 4: List Repos
```

---

## Key Point

The client connects to one server,
but that server can provide many tools.

---

# Another Example: Calendar MCP Server

One **Calendar MCP Server** could expose:

* `create_event`
* `update_event`
* `delete_event`
* `list_events`
* `check_availability`

---

## Architecture Structure

```
One client
One server connection
Multiple tools inside that server
```

---

# Simple Rule

## 1️⃣ One MCP client → One MCP server (1:1 connection)

## 2️⃣ One MCP server → Many tools (1:Many tools inside)

---

# Why This Design Is Powerful

This keeps:

* Clean separation between domains (GitHub vs Calendar vs Calculator)
* Organized tool grouping
* Scalable architecture

---

# Final Conclusion

So yes — an MCP server is meant to expose multiple tools.

It acts as a domain-specific toolbox,
and the client connects once,
but gains access to all tools inside that server.

# Summary Table

| Component               | Relationship               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| MCP Client → MCP Server | 1:1                        |
| MCP Server → Tools      | 1:Many                     |
| Result                  | Clean, Organized, Scalable |

# Concept in One Line

**One connection. Many capabilities. Clean architecture.**
