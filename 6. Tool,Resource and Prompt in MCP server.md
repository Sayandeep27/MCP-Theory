# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers

---

# MCP Servers can provide 3 things -  Tools, Resources, and Prompts

* Tools
* Resources
* Prompts

---

# 1. What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standard that allows AI clients (like IDEs, chat apps, or assistants) to connect to external servers.

These servers can provide:

* Executable tools
* Structured resources (data, files, APIs)
* Reusable prompt templates

MCP acts as a bridge between:

User → Client → MCP Server → External Systems (DB, APIs, Files)

---

# 2. What Can an MCP Server Provide?

An MCP server can expose three main capabilities:

| Capability | Purpose                       | Example              |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Tools      | Perform actions               | Send email, query DB |
| Resources  | Provide data                  | Files, database rows |
| Prompts    | Provide reusable instructions | Code review template |

---

# 3. TOOLS

## What are Tools?

Tools are **functions that perform actions**.

They are used when the LLM needs to:

* Fetch data
* Modify something
* Trigger an external operation

Tools are executable.

---

## Example 1: Weather Tool

### Server Tool Definition

```python
{
  "name": "get_weather",
  "description": "Get current weather for a city",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "city": {"type": "string"}
    },
    "required": ["city"]
  }
}
```

---

### User Query

```
What is the weather in Delhi?
```

---

### JSON-RPC Tool Call

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "arguments": {
      "city": "Delhi"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Server Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "temperature": "28°C",
    "condition": "Sunny"
  }
}
```

---

## Example 2: Database Query Tool

Tool: `get_user_orders`

Purpose: Fetch user purchase history from database.

---

# 4. RESOURCES

## What are Resources?

Resources are **data sources** exposed by the MCP server.

They do NOT execute actions.
They provide structured content.

Examples:

* Files
* API data
* Database records
* Documentation

---

## Example 1: File Resource

### Resource Definition

```json
{
  "uri": "file://company/policy.txt",
  "mimeType": "text/plain",
  "description": "Company policy document"
}
```

---

### Client Request

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "resources/read",
  "params": {
    "uri": "file://company/policy.txt"
  }
}
```

---

### Server Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": "All employees must follow security guidelines..."
}
```

---

## Example 2: API Resource

URI: `api://finance/stock/AAPL`

Returns structured JSON stock data.

---

# 5. PROMPTS

## What are Prompts?

Prompts are **predefined templates** stored on the MCP server.

They help:

* Standardize instructions
* Reuse complex prompt logic
* Enforce company guidelines

Prompts are NOT tools.
Prompts do NOT execute.

They return formatted text templates.

---

## Example 1: Code Review Prompt

### Prompt Definition

```json
{
  "name": "code_review",
  "description": "Review code professionally",
  "arguments": [
    {
      "name": "code",
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Client Request

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "method": "prompts/get",
  "params": {
    "name": "code_review",
    "arguments": {
      "code": "def add(a,b): return a+b"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Server Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "result": "Please review the following code for bugs, performance issues, and best practices: def add(a,b): return a+b"
}
```

---

# 6. Complete Flow Example

Step 1: User asks a question.

Step 2: Client sends JSON-RPC request.

Step 3: Server decides:

* Call tool?
* Fetch resource?
* Provide prompt?

Step 4: Server responds in JSON-RPC.

Step 5: Client converts response into readable answer.

---

# 7. Full Interaction Example

## User

```
Summarize company policy
```

## Flow

1. Client reads resource: `file://company/policy.txt`
2. Client gets summarization prompt
3. LLM generates summary

---

# 8. Summary Table

| Feature         | Tools      | Resources | Prompts              |
| --------------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| Executes action | Yes        | No        | No                   |
| Returns data    | Yes        | Yes       | Yes (template)       |
| Modifies system | Yes        | No        | No                   |
| Example         | Send email | Read file | Code review template |

---

# Final Understanding

MCP Servers provide three powerful building blocks:

1. Tools → Perform actions
2. Resources → Provide data
3. Prompts → Provide reusable instruction templates

Together, they allow AI systems to safely interact with real-world systems in a structured and standardized way.
