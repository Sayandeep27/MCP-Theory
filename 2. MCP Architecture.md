# MCP Architecture – Complete Beginner-Friendly Guide

---

## 📌 Overview

MCP's architecture is designed to be both simple and flexible, enabling smooth interaction between AI models and various data sources.

It works by connecting two key components:

* MCP Servers
* MCP Clients

This document explains the architecture in a clean, structured, and easy-to-understand way.

---

# 🏗 High-Level Architecture

```
User → MCP Client → MCP Server → External Tools / Data
```

Each component has a clear responsibility. Together, they create a standardized communication system between AI models and external services.

---

# 1️⃣ MCP Servers

## 📌 Definition

An MCP Server is an external service that executes actions (tools) or provides data based (data source) on client requests.


---

## 🧠 What MCP Servers Do

* Execute actions (tools)
* Provide structured data (data source)
* Connect AI system (chatbot, which you have created using langchain+flask+streamlit) to tools and APIs(data sources)
* Expose resources in a standardized format (json-rpc)

---

## 📂 Availability

MCP servers are commonly available as GitHub repositories in multiple programming languages:

* C#
* Java
* TypeScript
* Python

Many repositories include tutorials to help developers integrate quickly.

---

## 🤖 LLM Integration

Servers can also connect to LLM inference platforms (e.g., IBM, OpenAI) through the MCP SDK.

This allows them to expose LLM capabilities as standardized, reusable chat services.

---

## 🔌 Integration Examples

MCP servers can integrate with:

* Slack
* GitHub
* Git
* Docker
* Web search engines

---

## 🌍 Versatility

MCP servers support both:

### Internal Resources

* Databases
* Local files
* Enterprise systems

### External Services

* Public APIs
* Cloud platforms
* SaaS tools

combining both, we say - "data source"

---

# 📤 How MCP Servers can provide?

MCP servers can provide 3 things - Tools, Resources and Prompts.

---

## 1. Resources

**Purpose:** Fetch information from db/api or any other place

* Retrieve data from internal or external databases
* Returns data only
* No computation (unlike tools)
* No side effects

Example:

```
Fetch customer record
Fetch repository details
Retrieve document content

```

---

## 2. Tools

**Purpose:** Perform actions

* Connect with APIs or systems
* Can perform calculations
* Can execute queries
* Can trigger data actions
* May cause side effects

Example:

```
Create GitHub issue
Send Slack message
Run Docker container
Execute SQL query
Percentage Calculation

```

---

## 3. Prompts

**Purpose:** Standardize structured workflows.

* Provide reusable workflows
* Offer structured templates
* Standardize LLM-to-server communication

Example:

```
Code review workflow
Customer support workflow
Data analysis template
```

---

# 2️⃣ MCP Clients

## 📌 Definition

It converts user requests into structured MCP protocol messages that servers can process.

This is basically the chatbot that you have made using Langchain+flask+streamlit.

---

## 🔄 Core Responsibilities

* Convert user input into MCP-compliant messages (means in JSON-RPC format)
* Maintain communication with server
* Manage sessions
* Parse server responses
* Handle errors
* Validate context relevance

---

## 🔗 Connection Model

* A host can contain multiple clients (inside the host) - here host is the ai system ie:chatbot that you have made and it has multiple clients.
* Each client has a dedicated 1:1 connection to one server

This ensures clean separation and predictable communication.

```
 Imagine you build a customer support chatbot system for a company. The host is your main AI system (the chatbot backend running on your server). 
 Inside this host, there are multiple clients — for example, one client for the Github mcp server, one for the calculator mcp server, and one for calender mcp serber.
 Each client has its own dedicated 1:1 connection to a specific server endpoint (like an API service). 
 So when a user chats from the website, that website client communicates only with its assigned server connection, completely separate from the mobile app or WhatsApp client. 
 This separation ensures that messages don’t mix up, responses stay consistent, and communication remains clean and predictable.

```

---

## 🧩 Session Management

MCP clients manage:

* Interruptions
* Timeouts
* Reconnections
* Session closures

This ensures reliability and robustness.

---

## 🛡 Error Handling & Validation

Clients:

* Parse structured responses
* Perform error handling
* Verify outputs remain relevant to the given context

This prevents corrupted or irrelevant results from reaching the host.

---

## 💡 Example MCP Clients

Examples of systems that can act as MCP clients:

* IBM® BeeAI
* Microsoft Copilot Studio
* Claude.ai
* Windsurf Editor
* Postman

---

# 3️⃣ MCP Hosts (basically the clients) - *no need to study this*

## 📌 Definition

An MCP Host is the application where the user interacts with the AI system.

It embeds or runs MCP clients internally.

---

## 🧠 Host Responsibilities

* Accept user input
* Manage UI or application interface
* Contain one or more MCP clients
* Coordinate tool usage
* Present final responses to the user

---

# 🔄 Complete Interaction Flow (Step-by-Step)

Let’s walk through a real scenario.

### User Question:

"Create a GitHub issue and notify my team on Slack."

### Step 1 – Host

The user enters the request inside the MCP Host application.

### Step 2 – Client

The MCP Client:

* Converts the request into structured MCP protocol format
* Determines which server to contact

### Step 3 – Server

The MCP Server:

* Executes GitHub issue creation (Tool)
* Sends Slack notification (Tool)

### Step 4 – Response

The server returns structured confirmation.

The client parses it.

The host displays the final result.

# 📊 Architecture Summary Table

| Component  | Role                    | Key Responsibility                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| MCP Host   | User-facing application | Accepts input and displays output   |
| MCP Client | Communication bridge    | Converts requests into MCP protocol |
| MCP Server | Execution layer         | Performs actions and provides data  |

---

# 🧠 Why This Architecture Is Powerful

* Modular
* Scalable
* Standardized
* Plug-and-play
* Language-agnostic
* Tool-agnostic

It cleanly separates:

* User interaction
* Protocol communication
* Tool execution

---

# 🏁 Final Understanding

MCP Architecture connects AI systems to tools and data using a clean three-layer structure:

Host → Client → Server

Servers expose Resources, Tools, and Prompts.

Clients manage communication and sessions.

Hosts provide the user interface.

Together, they create a standardized and flexible ecosystem for AI-to-tool integration.
